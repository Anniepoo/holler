The space has two structures - a queue of messages and a mutable map of lists of listeners. Each is an agent.

in add-message this happens:

1. an action ADD  is created to add the message to the end of the queue.

ADD fires off PROCESS-ONE, appends the message to the queue, and exits.

PROCESS-ONE fires off PROCESS on the head of the queue  and returns the rest.
if the list is nil it just returns nil.

PROCESS fires off DISPATCH on the listeners and then fires off PROCESS-ONE.


DISPATCH does a chunked pmap on the listeners

if the add/remove listener code uses an agent, I think we're good



What about futures?
naw, agents seem the thing to do
